        <h1>SNAP benefits</h1>

        You can apply for SNAP benefits, (food stamps), on the <a href=https://coloradopeak.secure.force.com/ABWEL?Language=EN">Colorado PEAK website</a>, or fill out an application and
        turn it in at their office. However, currently due to covid-19 they are short staffed, and you are likely to
        have a quicker result by applying online. 

        


        <h1>SSI/SSDI </h1>



       <p> If you live in Colorado and would like to apply for Social Security disability, you have a few options. You can
        apply for disability in person by visiting your local Social Security office. You can also call the Social
        Security Administrationâ€™s customer service number at 800-772-1213. A few notes, however, the social security
        office is shorthanded due to covid-19, and some weeks will be closed to the public all together.</p>
        <br>



        <p>Before applying you will need to have a mailing address. If you are staying in a shelter, then talk to them
        about getting your mail there. If you are camping or on the streets, then apply for a PO Box at a post office
        center. They have programs for homeless populations.</p><br>



        <p>You will also need to get a medical doctor or psychiatrist to fill out and sign a Med-9 form in order to qualify
        for SSI/SSDI. You can get this done at <a href="https://www.coloradocoalition.org/healthcare">Stout Street Health Center</a>.</p><br>




        <p>Finally, if you are denied SSI/SSDI, then you need to appeal the decision. You can do this on your own, however,
        it is best to use a lawyer. They have to give you resources for this upon your request. Once you start the
        appeal process you will start getting AND payments to your EBT card. This money is a stop gap measure so you do
        not have to go without while the appeal process drags out. </p><br>
