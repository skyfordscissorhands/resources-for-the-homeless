    <p>- SNAP benefits



        You can apply for SNAP benefits, (food stamps), on the Colorado PEAK website, or fill out an application and
        turn it in at their office. However, currently due to covid-19 they are short staffed, and you are likely to
        have a quicker result by applying online. Here are the links for both.

        - SSI/SSDI and AND



        If you live in Colorado and would like to apply for Social Security disability, you have a few options. You can
        apply for disability in person by visiting your local Social Security office. You can also call the Social
        Security Administrationâ€™s customer service number at 800-772-1213. A few notes, however, the social security
        office is shorthanded due to covid-19, and some weeks will be closed to the public all together.



        Before applying you will need to have a mailing address. If you are staying in a shelter, then talk to them
        about getting your mail there. If you are camping or on the streets, then apply for a PO Box at a post office
        center. They have programs for homeless populations.



        You will also need to get a medical doctor or psychiatrist to fill out and sign a Med-9 form in order to qualify
        for SSI/SSDI. You can get this done at Stout Street Health Clinic.



        Finally, if you are denied SSI/SSDI, then you need to appeal the decision. You can do this on your own, however,
        it is best to use a lawyer. They have to give you resources for this upon your request. Once you start the
        appeal process you will start getting AND payments to your EBT card. This money is a stop gap measure so you do
        not have to go without while the appeal process drags out. </p>
