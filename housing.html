    <p>HUD has a list of shelters by state, however, it can be hard to find. The following link will show a list of
        approved shelters by city in Colorado.</p>


    <h1>Affordable Housing</h1>

    The following is a list of housing authority offices by city. You can apply for housing vouchers at any cities
    housing authorityâ€™s office. However, most housing voucher programs are done through a lottery system. We would
    advise first linking up with a case manager at the <a href="https://coloradocrisisservices.org/">Mental Health
        Center of Denver</a>, <a href="https://www.coloradocoalition.org/housing"> The Colorado Coalition for The
        Homeless</a>, or <a href="https://comitiscrisiscenter.org/comitis-crisis-center">Mile High Behavioral
        HealthCare</a>. All three are completely free and offer wrap around services.  

    <h3><a href="https://www.coloradocoalition.org/housing"> The Colorado Coalition for The
        Homeless</a></h3>
        <p>the Colorado Coalition for The Homeless is the only one who has their own apartment complexes</p>

    <h3><a href="https://comitiscrisiscenter.org/comitis-crisis-center">Mile High Behavioral
        HealthCare</a></h3>
        <p>Mile HighBehavioral HealthCare has their own short term housing vouchers. But these vouchers are limited and first come first
            serve.</p>
